# LowerMyRisk
LowerMyRisk creates a new risk metric using data models to calculate each personâ€™s risk of contracting COVID-19, on a scale of 1-10, based on their exposure to COVID-infected areas, people and densities of the areas users have been in. By curating a risk repository of the user throughout the day, LowerMyRisk serves as an automatic testing arm that can be plugged into EMRs or EHRs and supply medical facilities with an ongoing data set of risk, while providing recommendations for the users throughout the day about how to lower their risk score in real time.
Hey it's Alex!
